# angular-template

## What is this?

This is a template application that employs the MEAN Stack architecture. 

## How do I build this?

  - I'm assuming that you already have the following installed and configured:
  	- MongoDB
  	- Node.js and NPM

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/elklein96/angular-template`

2. Install some dependencies: `npm install && bower install`

3. Install Grunt locally: `npm install -g grunt-cli`

4. Run the app: `grunt`
  
  - Note: the default grunt task starts both the Mongo Daemon and the Express Server.

And that's it! Have fun!
